Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

- Use **Angular 20.x** and **Ionic 7.x** with **TypeScript**.
- Prefer **Ionic components** over plain HTML and **Ionic utility classes** over custom CSS.
- Always use **responsive design** for compatibility across screen sizes.
- Ensure seamless integration with the **Ionic framework** and follow Angular best practices.
- Follow **accessibility standards** (e.g., ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).
- Generate **modular, reusable, and component-based** code.
- Include **unit tests** for all new features and components.
- Use **lazy loading**, **change detection optimization**, and **async patterns** where applicable.
- Follow **consistent naming conventions** (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes/components).
- Keep code **clean, readable, and well-documented** with inline comments when necessary.
