* **Trust and Verification:** Emphasize the importance of identity verification for both libraries and students for safety and authenticity.

---

### **1. Public Page & Shared Elements**

**Goal:** Establish a common entry point and introduce the platform.

* **Common Login Page:**
    * **User Story (Public):** "As a potential user, I want a single, clear login page where I can choose to sign in as a Student, Library Manager, or Admin so I can access my respective account."
    * **Tech Notes:** Ionic routes for different login forms. Firebase Authentication for email/password.
* **About Us Page:**
    * **User Story (Public):** "As a potential user, I want to understand what 'Ekaant' is and its benefits (e.g., finding quiet study spaces, monetizing unused slots) so I can decide if it's right for me."
    * **Tech Notes:** Static Ionic page.
* **Help/Support/Feedback Page (Pre-Login - Placeholder):**
    * **User Story (Public):** "As a visitor, I want to see that there's a way to get help or provide feedback, even if I need to log in to submit a request, so I know support is available."
    * **Tech Notes:** Static page initially, directing users to log in for submission.
    * **Anonymous Submission (Post-Login):** "As a logged-in user, I want the option to submit feedback anonymously so I can share my thoughts without revealing my identity."
    * **Tech Notes:** Form with an optional checkbox for "Submit Anonymously." Store user ID but flag as anonymous in Firestore.

### **2. Library Manager Role**

**Goal:** Enable libraries to register, set up their profiles, and manage student registrations.

**Firebase Components:** Authentication, Firestore, Storage (for logo), Cloud Functions.

* **1. Register Library (Public Form - Initial Request):**
    * **User Story (Library Owner):** "As a library owner, I want to **register my library's basic details** (name, number of seats, map location URL, owner details like GST number/Pan Card/Aadhaar) through a public form so 'Ekaant' can verify my ownership and approve my listing."
    * **Tech Notes:**
        * Public Ionic form accessible without login.
        * Data submitted to a `library_registration_requests` collection in Firestore.
        * Validation for required fields.
        * Firebase Storage for GST/Aadhaar proof upload.
    * **User Story (Library Owner):** "As a library owner, upon successful submission, I want to receive a confirmation that my request is pending Admin approval."
    * **Tech Notes:** Confirmation message on screen, basic email (or in-app notification placeholder for MVP).

* **2. Complete Library Profile (Post-Approval):**
    * **User Story (Library Manager):** "As a library manager, once my library registration is approved by an Admin, I want to **log in using credentials provided** so I can complete my library's profile."
    * **Tech Notes:**
        * Admin creates Firebase Auth user for the manager upon approval.
        * Initial login might redirect to a profile completion page.
    * **User Story (Library Manager):** "As a library manager, I want to **upload my library's logo, define cubicle slot details** (e.g., 6-hour, 12-hour, specific timings), **set pricing** for these slots, and **specify if the library is for Boys, Girls, or Both**."
    * **Tech Notes:**
        * Ionic forms for profile completion.
        * Firebase Storage for logo.
        * Firestore collections: `libraries` (main data), `slots` (sub-collection under library or separate collection with library ID).
    * **User Story (Library Manager):** "As a library manager, I want to **add crucial compliance and safety information** like nearest police station, hospital, and emergency contact numbers so students feel secure."
    * **Tech Notes:** Text fields in the library profile in Firestore.
    * **User Story (Library Manager):** "As a library manager, I want to **see pending student registration requests** for my library so I can review them."
    * **Tech Notes:** Dashboard component fetching `student_registration_requests` from Firestore, filtered by `libraryId` and `status: 'pending'`.
    * **User Story (Library Manager):** "As a library manager, I want to **approve or reject student registration requests** for my library based on seat availability and upon receiving cash payment."
    * **Tech Notes:**
        * UI to view student details and proof.
        * Buttons for "Approve" / "Reject".
        * Firebase Cloud Function triggered on approval to update student's status, add them to `registered_students` list for that library, and possibly send a notification.
        * **Crucial MVP Flow:** Manager physically verifies payment, then marks as approved in the app. No in-app cash payment tracking in MVP, just approval of access.
    * **User Story (Library Manager):** "As a library manager, if there are no seats available, I want to **put a student's registration request into a waiting list** so they can be notified later."
    * **Tech Notes:** Status change to `status: 'waiting_list'` in `student_registration_requests`.

---

### **Firebase Specific Considerations for MVP:**

* **Firestore Data Model:**
    * `users` (root collection for all users, with `role` field: 'student', 'manager', 'admin')
    * `students` (details, ID proof reference, `verification_status`)
    * `libraries` (details, logo URL, `status: 'pending'/'approved'`)
    * `library_registration_requests` (temp collection for public submissions)
    * `student_registration_requests` (student applies to a library, `status: 'pending'/'approved'/'waiting_list'`)
    * `feedback_support` (messages from users, with `is_anonymous` flag)
* **Firebase Authentication:** Used for all user logins.
* **Firebase Storage:** For profile pictures, identity proofs, library logos.
* **Firebase Cloud Functions:**
    * `onLibraryRegistrationApprove`: Triggered by Admin approval, creates manager user, updates library status, sends email.
    * `onStudentRegistrationApprove`: Triggered by Manager approval, updates student status for that library, sends notification.
    * Potentially for sending emails/notifications.
* **Security Rules (Firestore/Storage):** Crucial for defining who can read/write what data based on user roles and UIDs. For example, a student can only read their own `student` document and `student_registration_requests` related to them, but all libraries can be browsed. Managers can only modify their own library data and process requests for their library.
